        <div> 
            <h3>PARC: Proximity</h3> 
                <p>
                    Tesla 
                    
                    <a href="https://www.tesla.com">Tesla.com</a>
                    <img src="lesson2/Images/Tesla-Mobile.png">

                Tesla shows a good use of proximity by placing the red car (the most obvious visual draw) at the center, 
                and the car is angled to follow the white line that leads the eye to the dark "custom order" button which
                is what the seller would want. Above the car the type of car is listed, and another smaller option to order the car is 
                coupled with it, and then above that is the brand "Tesla" creating a visual order that says, "Tesla made this model of car and this is 
                what it looks like, now go order it for yourself!"

                </p>
        </div>
       
        <div>
            <h3>White Space and Clean Design</h3>   
                <p> 
                    Apple
                    
                    <a href="https://www.apple.com/iphone-13-pro/>">Apple.com</a>
                    <img src="lesson2/Images/Apple-Mobile.png">

                Apple exemplifies clean design by using sleek simple shapes. The phone in the image is given a white padding background to focus
                the eye on the phone and the bold sans serif font on a 
                white background does not draw your focus away from that main selling point.
                </p>
        </div>
        
        <div>
            <h3>Rule of Thirds</h3>
                <p>
                    Twitter
                    
                    <a href="https://twitter.com/">Twitter.com</a>
                    <img src="lesson2/Images/Twitter-Mobile.png">

                The rule of thirds is harder to find in a mobile formate because of the limited space, however the Twitter sign-in page 
                does use it by having the options for sign-in aligned to the left and then the image of the bird at the bottom stretching from a centered
                position on to the right side of the screen.
